# Calculator
An Android calculator made using Android Studio

This app was made as a joke and is not meant to be used as an actual calculator. Although the basic four functions do work it does not have order of operations. There are special numbers that cause the calculator to behave differently and occasionally it will refuse to do calculations so it is meant only for entertainment.
